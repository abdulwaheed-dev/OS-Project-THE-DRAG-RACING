# OS-Project-THE-DRAG-RACING

### Introduction
We have designed a game named “The Drag Racing”. The idea of the game is that five cars will race across the screen and will gives us the winner. This project is based on the multi-threaded program. Each car is represented by thread. The main GUI will have five bars to show the progress of each car. The thread or car that will survive most time will be the winner.

### Multithreading?
Multithreading is a type of execution model that allows multiple threads to exist within the context of a process such that they execute independently but share their process resources. In multithreading, multiple thread executes concurrently supported by Operating System.

### Threads?
Thread is an execution unit which consists of its own program counter, a stack, and a set of registers. Threads are also known as Lightweight processes. Threads are popular way to improve application through parallelism. The CPU switches rapidly back and forth among the threads giving illusion that the threads are running in parallel. As each thread has its own independent resource for process execution, multiple processes can be executed parallel by increasing number of threads.

### How to run
Open Netbeans IDE. Import the project folder named as CarRace-master. Import the jfeonix.jar file into the project libraries. The .jar file is also placed in the CarRacing-master folder.
After importing the Project and the jar file simply run the code. Program will be executed and you will see a GUI having 2 buttons. On clicking the About Button you will see the members detail.
On clicking the Play Game Button another GUI will popup. In the second frame you will see 5 cards on the bottom and 3 buttons. One button is Start which will start the race among the cars. The 
other button is Reset, which will reset the positions of the car and the third button is Quit button which will exit the programme. The project is also demostrated in the video whos link is also
given at the bottom of this file.

#### Note: 
Netbeans IDE version 8_2 is required to run the programme because the mentioned version supports JAVAFX well. If you use any other version you will get issues in the jar files and
jre files.
